# Tax_Aware_v1


Based on the research paper " Tax-Efficient Portfolio Transition", I test a long only momentum strategy against a relaxed constraint momentum strategy.

S&P 500 stocks are used and most assumptions can be edited by the user.

The most relevant outputs are generated and the analysis can be observed.
