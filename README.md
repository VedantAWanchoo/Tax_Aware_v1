# Tax Effecient Portfolio Transition (Long Only vs. Relaxed Constraint)


Based on the research paper " Tax-Efficient Portfolio Transition", I test a long only strategy against a relaxed constraint strategy.

Buy and Hold for x months followed by long only momentum vs. Buy and Hold for the same x months followed by relaxed constraint momentum. 

S&P 500 stocks are used and most assumptions (Buy and Hold Months, Portfolio N, LTCG, STCG etc.) can be edited by the user.

The most relevant outputs are generated and the analysis can be observed.
